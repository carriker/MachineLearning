# MachineLearning
Created for Coursera Machine Learning class predmachlearn-032

This repository contains:
- the two .CSV files used in the assignment
- the Project.Rmd file that contains all the R code and analysis
- the Project.html file that results directly from knitting the .Rmd file
- the Project-cleaned.html file with the annoying nnet model output that I couldn't figure out how to keep out of the report manually removed
- 20 test output files (test01.txt to test20.txt) each containing a single test result
